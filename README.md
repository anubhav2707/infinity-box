We have a simple API that returns a JSON array of cosmetic products. We
would like you to display it in an organised way as specified below. In

addition, you should add a sorting and search mechanism to the front-
end. Feel free to use any frameworks you would like to achieve the task.

You would have to use three API’s to get products and their properties of
three brands “nyx, clinique, dior”.

Dior: https://makeup-
api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/products.json?brand=dior

NYX:
https://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/products.json?brand=nyx

Clinique: https://makeup-
api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/products.json?brand=clinique

Or you could use this API to get all the products of all brands, you are free

to choose whatever you feel comfortable using: https://makeup-
api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/products.json?
